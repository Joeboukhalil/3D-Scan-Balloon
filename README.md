# 3D-Scan-Balloon

## Overview
**3D-Scan-Balloon** is a conceptual project that proposes a new technique for 3D scanning using a flexible, vacuum-conformable balloon equipped with capacitive touch and thin film pressure sensors. The idea is to place an object within the balloon, apply vacuum pressure to mold it around the object, and then use combined sensor data to create a detailed 3D model. This approach has the potential to capture intricate details and contours of objects while remaining lightweight and flexible.

## Key Features
- **Flexible Balloon Structure**: A specialized balloon that can take the shape of an enclosed object when vacuumed, allowing for close contour matching.
- **Capacitive Touch Sensing**: Flexible capacitive sensors detect proximity and contours of the object, providing data on surface variations.
- **Thin Film Pressure Sensing**: Pressure sensors detect specific contact points and pressure distribution, enabling accurate modeling of sharp edges and grooves.
- **Hybrid Data Processing**: Combines data from both sensor types to produce a detailed and accurate 3D shape of the object.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to document and explain the concept, design, and potential applications of this 3D scanning technique. This repository currently focuses on theory, design concepts, and technical requirements. Future updates may include prototype designs and code for sensor data processing.
